# Adobe Connect ULaval Scheduler
This Chrome extension allows any student from Universit√© Laval to schedule their remote classes that use Adobe Connect. At the scheduled time, the remote class will be opened in a new tab.

There is also an auto-login feature and auto-fullscreen feature.

Finally, you can export your schedule to share with your friends or classmates. That means there is also an import schedule feature.

**Note that if you choose to use the auto-login feature, your ULaval network password will be stored in your Chrome sync storage in plain text.**

The extension can be found on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ahaafiokmkdhacbhcclbjplaekmbfnpi).
