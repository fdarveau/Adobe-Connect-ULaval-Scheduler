# Adobe Connect ULaval Scheduler
This Chrome extension allows any student from Université Laval to schedule their remote classes that use Adobe Connect. At the scheduled time, the remote class will be opened in a new tab.

There is also an ~~auto-login feature and~~ auto-fullscreen feature. (Auto-login feature removed to comply with Université Laval security policy)

Finally, you can export your schedule to share with your friends or classmates. That means there is also an import schedule feature.

The extension can be found on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ahaafiokmkdhacbhcclbjplaekmbfnpi).
